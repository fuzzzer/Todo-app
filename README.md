# to_do

 I am not sure how to fetch data when json contains list of maps e.g  
 "[{
    "id": 1,
    "todo": "Create dart server",
    "isDone": false,
    "description": "Create dart server using shelf packages."
},{
    "id": 2,
    "todo": "Implement router",
    "isDone": true,
    "description": "Implement router for the request handling."
},{
    "id": 3,
    "todo": "Create JSON file",
    "isDone": false,
    "description": "Create JSON file to parse it with request."
}]"


I ve tried to handle this kind of json with commented code in files:
'../../models/task.dart';
'../useful_methods.dart/communicate_with_server.dart';
'../ui/screens/see_task.dart';

I m not sure if this code works that's why I ve commented it, 
so if you wish to try it out you can simply uncomment everything with the header "//unComment next section"
